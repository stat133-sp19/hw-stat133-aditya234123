### [Cooking Recipe for everyday yellow dal:](https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/06/everyday-yellow-dal/)

### Ingredients:

-   1 cup yellow split peas, soaked in cold water for 1 hour
-   1 large tomato (about 8 ounces), cut into 8 wedges
-   1/4 cup canola oil
-   1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
-   1 medium red onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
-   5 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
-   1 teaspoon coriander seeds, finely ground
-   3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
-   1/2 teaspoon cayenne (I used 1/4, thought it was plenty, although I may be a wuss.)
-   1/4 cup minced cilantro leaves (I abhor cilantro, and always replace it with flat-leaf parsley.)
-   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
-   1 teaspoon salt

<br />

### Special Kitchen Tools:

-   Saucepan
-   Medium Skillet with lid

<br />

### Directions:

1.  Drain the dal and place it into the saucepan.
2.  Add the tomato and 3 cups of water, then bring it to a boil.
3.  Let it simmer for around 45 minutes - 1 hour, until peas are tender.
4.  Remove tomato skins and whisk the dal. Keep it warm.
5.  Heat the oil in the skillet on high heat.
6.  Once it is smoking, add cumin seeds and cover the skillet with the lid.
7.  Once it stops sputtering, add the garlic and sautee until the onion turns brown.
8.  Add coriander, turmeric, and cayenne to the dal and stir.
9.  Add cilantro, butter, and salt to the dal and let it simmer for another 5 minutes.
10. Serve :)

### Special Season:

*There isn't really a special season for it. It's a pretty common dish all throughout the year. A lot of people tend to enjoy it more during the summer.*

### Variations:

*Most variations involve just using different spices. A commenter noted that they added jalapenos and some other vegetables as well. They also used some other peppers to spice it up.*

[Euclidian Distance:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Definition)

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$) <br> <br> In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*1, *p*2, ..., *p**n*) and **q** = (*q*1, *q*2, ..., *q**n*) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) = \\textit{d}(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p2)^2 + ... + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$$
$$ = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i - p\_i)^2}.$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\| \\textbf{p} \\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \* \\textbf{p}},$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
